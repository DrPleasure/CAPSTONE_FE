Define the user flow: Start by defining the different screens that a user will encounter as they use your app. This includes the sign-up or login screen, the home screen, the event discovery screen, the event creation screen, the chat screen, the tournament creation screen, and any other screens that are necessary for your app. Map out how users will navigate between these screens.

Create a wireframe: Once you have defined the user flow, create a simple wireframe that shows the layout and placement of different elements on each screen. A wireframe is a low-fidelity visual representation of your app that shows the basic structure and layout of the interface, without worrying about visual design details such as colors or images. You can use a tool like Balsamiq or Figma to create your wireframes.

Add visual design: Once you have a basic wireframe, you can start adding visual design elements to your mockup, such as colors, fonts, images, and icons. Use your wireframe as a guide for where to place these design elements.

Refine and iterate: As you add more detail to your mockup, you may find that you need to refine and iterate on certain parts of the design to improve the user experience. Be willing to make changes and test your mockup with real users to see how they interact with it.

Remember that the goal of a mockup is to give you a sense of how your app will look and function, but it doesn't need to be perfect or polished. The important thing is to create a clear and functional design that users will find easy to navigate and use.
